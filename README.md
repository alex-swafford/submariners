# submariners
A multiplayer submarine browser game.

## Running the server
The root folder is the server folder.  It contains the client folder because the server will serve the client.  To run the server:
```
> cd client
> npm run build
> cd ..
> npm start
```
The client is now served by the server and can be accessed at localhost:3000.

## Running the client separately:
```
> cd client
> npm start
```
The client can now be accessed at localhost:3000 by a browser.
